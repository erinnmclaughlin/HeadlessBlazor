> [Headless Blazor](https://github.com/erinnmclaughlin/HeadlessBlazor) is a headless UI component library for Blazor. Inspired by [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/).

<br>

> [!NOTE]  
> This library is very much a work-in-progress. Contributions are welcome!

### Try the Preview

Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HeadlessBlazor).

```cmd
dotnet add package HeadlessBlazor
```

#### Looking for individual components?
Each component is packaged separately, so if you're only after one or two specific components, you can install those individually:

```cmd
dotnet add package HeadlessBlazor.{Component}
```

## Features for v1 Release

### Other Things to Do:
